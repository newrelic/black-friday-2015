Black Friday 2015

There are 2 scripts per website i.e. 2 for store.apple.com and 2 for store.google.com

For each of the websites, the scripts-AppleTV/GoogleChromcast simulate a real user ordering an Apple TV/Google Chromecast from the respective websites.

The scripts-Apple_OrderPhone/Google_OrderPhone simulate a user workflow that navigates from the store front to the page where an iPhone6s/Nexus6 can be ordered.
